### This is my teams project in college to see if we could replicate Tesla's used car database system.

### This project was based around MYSQL as it was the subject of the class.

### We studied how the target site (https://www.tesla.com/inventory/used/ms?arrangeby=plh&zip=95113) presented data, and based our schema's off of that.
